# Yahtzee Beginner's Guide

Welcome to Yahtzee! This step-by-step guide will help you learn how to play this fun dice game.

## What You Need to Know

Yahtzee is played with 5 dice and a scorecard. Your goal is to roll dice combinations that score the most points.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Understanding Your Turn

Each turn, you get up to 3 rolls to make the best possible combination:

- **Roll 1**: Roll all 5 dice
- **Roll 2**: Keep some dice, roll the rest (optional)
- **Roll 3**: Keep some dice, roll the rest (optional)

### Step 2: How to Roll and Keep Dice

1. Click "Roll Dice" to roll all 5 dice
2. Click on individual dice to "hold" them (they'll be highlighted)
3. Click "Roll Dice" again to roll only the unheld dice
4. Repeat up to 3 total rolls per turn

### Step 3: Understanding the Scorecard

#### Upper Section (Easy to Understand)

- **Ones**: Count all dice showing 1, multiply by 1
- **Twos**: Count all dice showing 2, multiply by 2
- **Threes**: Count all dice showing 3, multiply by 3
- **Fours**: Count all dice showing 4, multiply by 4
- **Fives**: Count all dice showing 5, multiply by 5
- **Sixes**: Count all dice showing 6, multiply by 6

**Example**: If you roll 2, 2, 2, 4, 6 and choose "Twos", you score 6 points (three 2s × 2 = 6)

#### Lower Section (Combinations)

- **Three of a Kind**: 3+ dice of same number → Add all dice
- **Four of a Kind**: 4+ dice of same number → Add all dice
- **Full House**: 3 of one number + 2 of another → 25 points
- **Small Straight**: 4 numbers in a row → 30 points
- **Large Straight**: 5 numbers in a row → 40 points
- **Yahtzee**: All 5 dice the same → 50 points
- **Chance**: Any combination → Add all dice

### Step 4: Scoring Examples

**Example 1**: You roll 3, 3, 3, 1, 5
- You could score 9 in "Threes" (3 + 3 + 3)
- You could score 15 in "Three of a Kind" (3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 5)
- You could score 15 in "Chance" (3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 5)

**Example 2**: You roll 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- You could score 40 in "Large Straight" (5 consecutive numbers)
- You could score 20 in "Chance" (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)

### Step 5: Strategy Tips for Beginners

#### Early Game Strategy

- Try to score well in the upper section (aim for 3+ of each number)
- Don't waste good combinations on low-scoring categories

#### What to Aim For

- **Upper Section**: Try to get at least 3 of each number (total 63+ for bonus)
- **Yahtzee**: Always go for it when you have 3+ of the same number
- **Straights**: Look for consecutive numbers (1-2-3-4 or 2-3-4-5-6)

#### When to Use "Chance"

- When you have a high-scoring combination that doesn't fit other categories
- As a backup when you can't score anywhere else

### Step 6: Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid
